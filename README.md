<p align="center">
    Demo application to create and keep your notes and tasks.
</p>

This project is a demonstration application that should present the abilites and skills of [Callstack.io](https://callstack.com) company in creating React Native Windows **desktop** applications.

The idea behind creating the Notes app was to include some features of Windows and React Native Windows [APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/consume-apis) but also to create the application that will contain all the most common usage scenarios of an example desktop application.

The development of this application was also a perfect opportunity to mix both React Native (JavaScript) development with the native UWP (C++) features.
It means that beside standard React Native components there is a whole UWP layer which handles all the navigation, animations, and content of a Windows desktop app.
Please check the [Approach](#Approach) section for more details.
